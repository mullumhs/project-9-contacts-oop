# Project 8: Contacts

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 8 for the MHS Software Engineering class. The focus of this project is to create a Contacts application in Python.

## Main Project: Contacts Program
- File: [`contacts.py`](contacts.py)
- Description: Develop a Contacts application in Python that allows users to manage their contact list. The application should enable users to add new contacts, update existing contacts, delete contacts, search for specific contacts, and list all contacts using a procedural approach.

## Task Requirements
- The program should be written in Python.
- Students must use functions to encapsulate the functionality of the program.
- The program should offer a menu-driven interface to interact with the user.
- Proper input validation should be implemented for robustness.
- The program should handle edge cases, like searching for a non-existent contact, gracefully.

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of Python data structures, particularly dictionaries.
- Deepen comprehension of functions and procedural programming concepts.
- Apply logical thinking and problem-solving skills in a practical programming task.
- Prepare for the transition to object-oriented programming in future lessons.
